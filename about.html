      A popular pub located in the wizarding village of Hogsmeade, The Three Broomsticks is a warm, cosy place owned and run by Madam Rosmerta. Established in 1452. Rumoured to be as old as the village itself, the inn was popular not only with villagers but also hags and other non-human magical beings. The Three Broomsticks served drinks such as Butterbeer and Firewhisky and was popular with Hogwarts teachers and students alike.
